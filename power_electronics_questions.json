The method of interfacing the solar panels with the power system is via a full-wave SCR bridge as shown in Fig. 4-14 except with the dc source having the opposite polarity. Individual solar panels produce a voltage of 12 V. Therefore, the voltage from the solar panel array can be established at any multiple of 12 by connecting the panels in appropriate combinations. The ac source is (120) sin (377 12 t) V. The resistance is 1 Ω.", "Classification & Category": "Full-wave SCR bridge for solar power integration",
